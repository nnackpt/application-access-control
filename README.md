# üöÄ Next.js Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This project is a boilerplate for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a modern Next.js application. It provides a foundational structure for managing user roles and permissions, protecting routes, and conditionally rendering UI elements based on the authenticated user's role (e.g., `ADMIN` vs. `USER`).

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Authentication:** A basic authentication flow to handle user sessions.
-   **Role Management:** Pre-configured roles like `ADMIN` and `USER`.
-   **Protected Routes:** Secure pages and API routes using Next.js Middleware.
-   **Conditional UI Rendering:** Show or hide components based on user permissions.
-   **Modern Stack:** Built with the Next.js App Router and TypeScript.

## üíª Tech Stack

-   Next.js ‚Äì The React Framework for Production
-   React ‚Äì A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-   TypeScript ‚Äì Typed JavaScript at Any Scale
-   Tailwind CSS ‚Äì (Optional, but recommended) A utility-first CSS framework
